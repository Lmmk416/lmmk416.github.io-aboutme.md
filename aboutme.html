I recently graduated in May, 2022, with a Bachelors of Science in Biomedical Engineering on a pre-medicine track. 
I will be returning to the Univeristy of Buffalo to complete a Masters of Art in Biological Sciences, with a focus in Anatomy & Physiology.

I am currently based in the Bay Area & I am an Assay Development Research Intern at Lucira Health.
I am interested in the medical devices field, more specifically, orthopedic and surgical devices. 
I am currently continuing to work on a 3D printed, anatomcially correct hand that will be used for orthopedic surgical training.

I would like to work full time in the Bay Area with a start date around June 2023.
